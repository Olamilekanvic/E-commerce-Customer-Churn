💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM YOUR DATA
The Story Your Data Tells:

1. Engagement is KEY 🎯

All your top negative correlations are engagement metrics
Active users (logging in, browsing, using app) don't churn
Passive users (not engaging) are at risk


2. Customer Service is a RED FLAG 🚩

The strongest predictor of churn is customer service calls
This suggests customers with problems are leaving
Action: Your company should improve problem resolution


3. Cart Abandonment Matters 🛒

Second strongest predictor
People want to buy but something stops them
Action: Optimize checkout process, reduce friction


4. Recency is Important ⏰

Days since last purchase matters
Need to re-engage inactive customers before they're gone
